What LootBin does
LootBin is a focused tool for OSINT work. It scans Ter m bin paste streams, extracts textual content, and flags keywords, phrases, and patterns that researchers care about. It supports incremental runs, persistent state, and export options so you can study past results or wire LootBin into larger data workflows.

Why use LootBin
- Speed: It runs locally and processes large text batches efficiently.
- Reproducibility: You can reproduce searches and results with a consistent command line interface.
- Extensibility: Itâ€™s easy to add new scanners or export targets as your research needs grow.
- Transparency: Outputs are structured and easy to parse by humans and machines.

Key features
- Ter mbin paste scanning with keyword-based filtering
- Real-time-ish monitoring mode for ongoing paste streams
- Flexible output: JSON, CSV, or human-friendly terminal tables
- Conflict-free state management to resume work
- Simple configuration and sane defaults for quick starts
- Lightweight footprint with minimal dependencies

How LootBin works
- The tool pulls public paste text from Ter m bin pages or streams.
- It tokenizes and analyzes the text, looking for configured keywords and patterns.
- It buffers results and writes them to a chosen output sink (file or stdout).
- It keeps a local state so repeated runs donâ€™t flood you with duplicates unless you want them.
- It can run in batch mode or in monitoring mode for ongoing observation.

Tech stack
- Language: Python 3.x
- Core libraries: requests, beautifulsoup4 (for parsing), re (for regex filtering), json, csv
- Output: JSON and CSV formats for easy ingestion
- Optional: asyncio-based streaming for responsive monitoring

Getting started
Prerequisites
- A system with Python 3.8 or newer
- Basic familiarity with the command line
- Network access to Ter m bin paste sources

Installation
- Clone the repository or install via packaging if available in the future
- Create and activate a virtual environment
- Install dependencies
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
- Confirm you can run LootBin with a simple command

Configuration
- LootBin uses a small config file to tailor behavior
- You can define:
  - Keywords and patterns to watch
  - Source URLs or sources for Ter m bin pastes
  - Output destinations and formats
  - Rate limits and time windows
- A sample configuration shows reasonable defaults and safe presets, designed to require minimal customization for first-time users

Usage
CLI basics
- lootbin start --config config.yaml
- lootbin scan --keywords "data breach" --days 7
- lootbin monitor --interval 60s
- lootbin export --format json --output results.json

- lootbin help shows available commands and options
- The CLI is designed to be straightforward: commands map to actions, options refine behavior

Queries and filters
- You can filter by keywords, phrases, or regular expressions
- Case sensitivity is configurable
- Date range filters let you study paste activity over a specific window
- You can combine multiple filters to narrow results

Output formats
- JSON: structured, easy to load into data pipelines
- CSV: compatible with spreadsheets and many BI tools
- Human-readable: pretty-printed text for quick scanning in the terminal

Data handling and outputs
- Local state management ensures you can resume work without reprocessing everything
- Outputs can be appended to existing files or written as new files
- Pasted content is saved in a way thatâ€™s easy to inspect, but you can limit the amount of raw text if needed
- All outputs come with timestamps, source identifiers, and keyword hits

Architecture and design
- Modular structure: core engine, scanners, filters, exporters, and a CLI
- Core engine coordinates work: fetch paste sources, apply filters, emit results
- Scanners handle specific sources or strategies for paste retrieval
- Filters implement keyword and pattern matching
- Exporters are responsible for writing results to JSON/CSV or stdout

Extensibility and contributions
- The project uses a plugin-like approach for scanners and exporters
- To add a new paste source, implement a small adapter that provides a uniform interface:
  - fetch_pastes(range) -> iterable of Paste objects
  - each Paste includes text, source_id, timestamp, and raw content
- To add a new export format, implement an exporter adhering to the expected API
- Contributions are welcome. Please follow the repositoryâ€™s guidelines:
  - Open an issue to discuss larger changes
  - Submit a PR with tests and documentation updates
  - Ensure code style aligns with existing conventions
- Tests rely on a lightweight suite that exercises parsing, filtering, and export paths

Testing and quality
- Unit tests cover:
  - Keyword matching logic
  - Regex filtering
  - Output formatting
  - State persistence
- A basic integration test exercises the flow from fetching to exporting
- CI runs ensure compatibility with target Python versions and common platforms
